## Data included in analysis

All cases signed out between 01-01-2015 and 12-31-2021 were exported from LigoLab and included in the analysis. There were `r  raw_counts %>% summarize(n()) %>% prettyNum(big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)` total cases signed out, including cases re-released with revisions. Annual volumes were calculated as the total number of unique accessions, unique Result IDs, and the total count of CPT codes. The 80000 (non-billable) CPT code was excluded from the annual CPT code volume calculations. Table 1 below summarizes volumes by these three metrics from 2015 -- 2021.

```{r summary-table-without-80000, include=TRUE}
knitr::kable(volumes_no_80000, format.args = list(big.mark = ",",
  scientific = FALSE), caption = "**Table 1. Annual Volumes by Accessions, Result IDs, and CPT Codes (80000 removed)**")

# gt::gt(volumes)
```

To fully capture the amount of work performed idependent of realized revenue, the same data are presented below (Table 2) with the 80000 CPT code included.

```{r summary-table-with-80000, include=TRUE}
knitr::kable(volumes_80000, format.args = list(big.mark = ",",
  scientific = FALSE), caption = "**Table 2. Annual Volumes by Accessions, Result IDs, and CPT Codes (80000 included**")
```

The number of results released has increased from **`r result_id$n_result_ids[ 1]`** to **`r result_id$n_result_ids[7]`** or by **`r result_id$n_result_ids[7] - result_id$n_result_ids[ 1]`** from 2015--2021.
